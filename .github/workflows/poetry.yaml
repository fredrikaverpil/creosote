            ### `poetry update` log:

            - This follows the pinning rules set in `pyproject.toml`, meaning some dependencies are not updated without a change of pinning.
            - Note that some dependencies no longer used are also removed.

            ```bash
            ${{ env.POETRY_UPDATED }}
            ```
